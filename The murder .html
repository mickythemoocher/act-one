<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Would anyone like a drink?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes please I'll have a scotch<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">Anyone else<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> If there is any white wine that would be nice.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> I'll check. How about you Inspector?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> (curtly) Not for me thank you, not while I am on duty.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">Yes of course.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> I would like get this sorted out, rather than start drinking.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Sort what out?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Oh for goodness sake. The murder of course<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> But Alex, there hasn't been a murder.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">How do we know?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">(Sarcastically)Well let me do a head count. Hmm Muriel, Jane, Alex and myself. Now let me see, that's one two, three, four. We all seem to be here. Please put your hand up if any of you have been murdered. (short pause) I see, no hands up so looks like there was no murder.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Ha ha ha, very funny. I am trying to be serious.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Here is your scotch Michael.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">And so am I , none of us, as yet, have been murdered. Thank you Muriel.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Suppose it is not one of us?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean Alex?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe there is someone else in the house, or was.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">I suppose that is possible, it's a big house. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, so let's search the house, room by room.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I am afraid that is not possible.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">This is a police matter madam, we cannot allow you to just wander through the rest of the house and possibly contaminate evidence.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Here is your wine Jane, sorry I over filled it a little.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Thanks Moo.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Well if it is police matter inspector, why are you not policing? If we can't do the search, are you going to?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> All in good time sir, all in good time.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> And are there any more policemen on the way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Well, we will have to see about that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">I think the whole thing is rather fun.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Rather fun? I am afraid miss that I do not share your opinion that murder is rather fun.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Oh come on inspector. There has been no murder here. Not even a decent argument.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">That's true, we all seem to get on rather well.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">I agree with you Jane, this whole thing does seem rather trivial. And before you say it inspector, I don't mean that murder is trivial, just this situation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">This situation sir?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Yes inspector. You seem to be investigating a murder that never was.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> That is rather cutting Mike. The inspector is just doing his job.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> And it is not a job I would like to do â€“ too grisly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> As far as I can see he is doing no job at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">Well at least let him try to do his job.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Quite right miss.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Well that job doesn't seem to include very much investigating.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">On the contrary. I may be doing far more than you realise.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> So what do you have so far? Apart from our names?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I have suspicions.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">So inspector, if you are saying you have your  suspicions. Does that infer that (a short pause) one of us is your suspect?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> It infers nothing of the kind sir. I have as yet, no suspects at all.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Pardon me for butting in inspector but it seems apart from no suspects you also seem to have no body.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes one of the prime ingredients of a murder really I would think.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> As I said before sir, this is no joke.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">I didn't intend it as a joke and I am sorry if it appeared that way.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> So what is the next move? Are we to be interrogated?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> You seem in rather a hurry sir. Is there a reason for that?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> No of course not. I just feel that there is very little actually being done.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> But you feel I should interrogate you all?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> No I don't feel that at all, it was just a question, that is all.<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> You can interrogate me if you wish inspector, I have nothing to hide. And I never have.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Nor do I. You can do me next. In a way it is quite exciting. I have never been interrogated before. I must be very boring, I never do anything bad.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> There will be no interrogation, at least not for the time being. First of course there will be the search.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> For a body? I mean that would be a start wouldn't it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I must tell you sir there is often no body to be found in a murder investigation.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Ok, whatever you say.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Well I say if you are here to investigate maybe you should start investigating.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Once again sir, it seems you are in somewhat of a rush. Do you have something to hide? Something you re not telling us?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex.</font color="#0000FF"> Oh! For goodness sake. Of course not. Why should I have anything to hide just because I want to get this over with?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Slowly, slowly catchee monkee. As my grandmother used to say.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Maybe we need your grandmother here as well then.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe Inspector, we could all help with the search. I mean under your supervision.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Very kind of you to offer Miss but that will not be necessary. Members of the public are rarely helpful in these situations. That has been my past experience anyway.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">That is a rather scathing comment inspector.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I apologise if that sounded rude madam. I just meant that policeman are trained to search properly whereas members of the public are not. It is just a fact of life.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Trained by your grandmother I assume.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Don't be rude Michael.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Well, this whole thing is becoming a bit of a farce.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I assure you it isn't sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> So what do we do now then? Just sit here and wait to  see what happens next?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">I assure you all I will clear this matter up as quickly as I can.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Not like the monkey then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Michael! Stop it!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">So if we just have to sit and wait I am going to have another drink. Anyone else?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Yes please Moo, that wine was rather nice.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> That's odd! I mean very odd.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane, Michael and Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> (together)What is?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Well, you just said that the wine I poured you was rather nice.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, I did and it was. I was surprised at how nice it was.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> How do you know? How do you know what it tasted like?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> What do you mean Moo?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF">It is still on the table, you haven't touched it so how could you say it was nice?<p>
(A short pause)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Errr... I thought I had drunk it. In fact, I am sure I did<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> You couldn't have drunk it if it's still on the table.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">I am sure I did.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">look the glass is still completely full.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">(sharply) Don't touch that glass sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael. </font color="#0000FF">Why not?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Evidence sir, and we must not tamper with it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">(laughing) What evidence. There is no clue there. Jane just forgot that she hadn't drunk her wine.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I didn't forget. I am so sure I drank it, I remember the taste.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Forgetting to drink ones wine is hardly a crime inspector. Not one that I have ever hear of anyway.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I know, I did drink it. I can even remember the taste.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Never mind Jane, not a problem. I am going to pour myself one though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> I'll have a scotch if there is one. <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">There is scotch. In fact there is about every possible drink you can imagine.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">(Quietly) I am sure I did drink it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">Please make sure nobody touches that glass.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> It seems inspector that you are clutching at straws if that glass is your only evidence.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Maybe it is a suspect too. Sorry, I am making jokes again and I shouldn't.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">You seem determined to make a joke of this sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> I am sorry. I am just a little frustrated by all this. Nothing seems to be getting done.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> You are wrong sir. I feel I am making great progress. I am sure, more than you possibly realise<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Well that's good to hear. I would like to get this over and get out of here. I am finding this whole situation too scary.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes so am I Jane.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> So will this murderous mystery without a murder soon be solved?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> As I said sir, I will complete my investigation as quickly as possible.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> I am pleased to hear that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> And of course solving one mystery may help solve another.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">What do you mean by that? What other mystery?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Are the mysteries accumulating then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">It would appear so sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">Like what?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Like the glass of wine sir.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael:</font color="#0000FF"> Ha! Oh no not the glass of wine again .<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Once again. Not a laughing matter. It is very relevant.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel:</font color="#0000FF"> In what way?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, in what way. I want to know because I am convinced I drank it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> I believe you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Jane: </font color="#0000FF">Do you:<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">I believe you are convinced you drank it. On the other hand, I don't believe you did.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">It seems inspector you are making this more of a mystery than it actually is.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">I'd agree with that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector: </font color="#0000FF">You are both entitled to your opinions of course but for me this investigation is proceeding in a very positive way.<p>
<font color="#0000FF"> Jane:</font color="#0000FF"> Because of the wine?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Yes, amongst other things.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Are you able to share with us what those other things are?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> Not at the moment, I would rather wait until my suspicions are a little more confirmed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex: </font color="#0000FF">We wait with bated breath:<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> So my next part of the investigation is the search for the murder weapon. I may not find one but it will be my intention to look in every conceivable nook and cranny.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Michael: </font color="#0000FF">Really? You mean you  are actually going to search the place?<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF">I am indeed sir. And search it very thoroughly indeed.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Muriel: </font color="#0000FF">And do you hope to find a body?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> No, I don't actually. It is the last thing I expect to find.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Alex:</font color="#0000FF"> Why not? This is a murder investigation isn't it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Inspector:</font color="#0000FF"> It is indeed sir, but there has been no murder (Short Pause) Not as yet!<p>
